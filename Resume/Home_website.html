        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Iâ€™m an aspiring web and graphics designer as well as an aspiring photographer. I go to Stuyvesant High School and I took Intro to Computer Science 1 and 2 and APCS as well. I also challenged myself to take the genetics elective at my school and I wrote a research paper about a potential cure for the hereditary disease, G6PDD. I'm looking toward a Computer Science major in college, as well as studying along the pre-law track.My goal is to improve my public speaking by going through Startup Tech.</p>
